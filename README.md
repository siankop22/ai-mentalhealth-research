# AI for Mental Health Distress Detection (Independent Research)

## Objective
Investigate whether multilingual transformer models (e.g., XLM-R) can identify emotional distress in text written in English and Burmese/Zomi.

## Research Question
Can a multilingual model detect distress-related posts with ≥ 0.75 macro-F1 while minimizing false positives across languages?

## Deliverables
- Clean dataset (English + Burmese/Zomi)
- Baseline and fine-tuned models
- Model & data cards
- 4–6 page research paper
- Streamlit demo (local-only)

## Ethics
No diagnostic claims. All text anonymized; only public, consented data used.
