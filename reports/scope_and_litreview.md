Title:
Detecting Distress in Multilingual Text: Building an AI System for Early Mental Health Support Across English and Burmese/Zomi

Problem Statement:
Millions share mental health struggles online, but most tools focus on English-only data and miss expressions in low-resource languages like Burmese or Zomi. This project aims to build and evaluate a multilingual model that identifies early signs of emotional distress in short text posts while minimizing false positives. The goal is not diagnosis but timely support—helping bridge the language and access gap in digital mental health monitoring.

Objectives:

Collect or adapt small Burmese/Zomi text samples reflecting emotional tone.

Train baseline (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) and multilingual transformer (XLM-R) models.

Evaluate cross-lingual performance and robustness.

Produce an ethical, reproducible prototype and data/model cards.

Target Metrics:

Primary: Macro-F1 ≥ 0.75 on distress detection.

Secondary: Recall ≥ 0.85 for the distress class; < 10% variance between English vs. Burmese/Zomi F1.

Runtime goal: < 300 ms inference on CPU.

Ethics Guardrails:

The system does not replace clinicians or provide diagnostic claims.

All data will be public, anonymized, or synthetic.

Sensitive posts will be paraphrased or excluded.

Model outputs include a clear disclaimer and resource links (e.g., hotlines).

Results and biases (language, cultural expression) will be transparently reported.

📚 Seed Papers and Summaries
Milne, D. N., Pink, G., & Calvo, R. A. (2016). “Detecting Depression and Anxiety from Social Media Text.” IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing.	2016	Milne et al. present early work using lexical and linguistic cues from Twitter and forums to classify depression and anxiety. They compare n-gram and LIWC features with SVM and Random Forest classifiers, achieving moderate F1 (≈ 0.70). The paper’s strength lies in its careful annotation scheme and analysis of language patterns. However, it’s limited to English, short posts, and small data diversity. It highlights how “informal emotional cues”—misspellings, emojis, and metaphors—are strong indicators of mood. For this project, the paper provides baseline features and motivates inclusion of informal markers in multilingual text.
Suhaimi, N. S., & Sani, N. (2020). “Cross-Lingual Sentiment Analysis for Low-Resource Languages Using Multilingual BERT.” Procedia Computer Science.	2020	This paper explores adapting Multilingual BERT (mBERT) for Malay and Indonesian sentiment classification via zero-shot transfer from English. The authors fine-tune on English datasets, then test on translated text and small native samples. mBERT maintains 70–80% of English accuracy, showing promising transfer even with minimal data. Limitations include poor idiom coverage and cultural nuance loss. The work supports the idea that transformer-based multilingual encoders can generalize across languages sharing limited data. This informs the proposed project’s use of XLM-R for Burmese/Zomi by leveraging English mental-health corpora and small native samples.
Tadesse, M. M., et al. (2019). “Detection of Depression-Related Posts on Reddit Using Machine Learning Techniques.” PeerJ Computer Science.	2019	Tadesse et al. curate a large Reddit dataset labeled for depression and anxiety, applying TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and LSTM models. Their best model (Bi-LSTM) achieves F1 ≈ 0.78. They also emphasize ethical risks of misclassification and privacy. Importantly, they provide a transparent preprocessing pipeline and open data, enabling reproducibility. This serves as a solid English benchmark dataset for this project’s initial training. The methodology—feature extraction, model comparison, and error analysis—provides a template for evaluating multilingual extensions while maintaining ethical data handling practices.
